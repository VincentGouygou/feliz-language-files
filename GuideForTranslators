Additional Notes to translators
-------------------------------
Use a text editor, such as notepad, and turn Line-numbers on.

Please translate all lines at exactly the same line number as in the English file.
Do not add or delete any lines (this is very important).

Some lines in the English file have the words linked with underscores.
This is because they are used in simple, 'one-word' menus.
So please make sure to also link the words on that line of your translation with underscores or hyphens.
Also, if a line in the English file is only one word, and if your translation is more than one word, please link your words with underscores or hyphens.

Tha Arch Linux console in which the installation of Feliz runs, is only 80 characters wide.
So if any translated line will be over 80 characters, please re-phrase to make it shorter
(preferably less than 70 characters, as some lines have to fit complex menus).

If you have any questions or problems, please email me: liz@feliz.one or contact me through Facebook

Thank you for your contribution to Feliz
